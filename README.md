# Drum beats

This is a project done for FCC, my variation on the Simon says app.

## Changelog
DATE: 10.5.2018
```
 Added the sounds to the drum, a button that starts the sequence of drum playing. Game doesn't have the actual game functionality yet. Bugs i currently have:
1. The button bug, moves to another position when clicked
2. Sound bug, sometimes if the same drum is played right after the sound won't play. Will have to play around the settimeout function.
3. Atm not responsive website, but that will come latter on

```

Plans: By the end of the month have the core game mechanic done so you can play. Later on add the leaderboards feature so you can save your highscore.
